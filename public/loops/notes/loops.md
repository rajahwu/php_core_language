# Loops

Execute a piece of code until some condition becomes false

While [SOME CONDITION] is true, execute [CODE].
If [SOME CONDITION] becomes false, move on.

## All Loops Should Have

* A true/false condition
* A statement that moves that condition towards becoming false

```php
$i = 1;

CONDITION: ($i < 10) {
    // Code to execute
    $i++; // Code to move condition towards false.
}
```
